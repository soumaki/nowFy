This guide will help you set up your Spotify credentials and use the plugin to display your currently playing track.

---

## 1. Create a Spotify Developer App

- Go to [https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/create)
- Click **"Create an App"**
- Fill in the app name and description
- **Add a Redirect URI** (required), MANDATORY:
- THIS ONE:  
  `https://example.com/callback`

- Check the **“I understand”** box to accept Spotify’s terms  
- Click **"Create"**

---

## 2. Get Your Credentials

- After creating the app, copy your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**

## 3. Set Credentials in the Plugin

In your chat with the plugin, send:

```
.setid YOUR_CLIENT_ID
```

Then:

```
.setsecret YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET
```

---

## 4. Generate Your Login Link

Now that your credentials are set, run the appropriate command depending on your plugin version:

**For version 1.0.3:**

```
.update
```

**For version 1.0.5 and above:**

```
.connect
```

This will generate a personalized link using your Client ID.

---

## 5. Authorize the App

- Open the link generated by `.update` or `.connect`  
- Log in to your Spotify account  
- Click **"Agree"** to authorize the app

After authorization, you will be **automatically redirected** to a URL like this:

![nowFy](https://github.com/soumaki/nowFy/blob/main/img/App.png)

```
https://example.com/callback?code=YOUR_CODE_HERE
```

Just copy this entire link — you’ll use it in the next step.

---

## 6. Submit the Code

**As of version 1.0.2**, the plugin accepts the **full URL** returned after authorization, and it will extract the code for you automatically.

**Both formats below are valid:**

```
.code abc123xyz
```

or simply:

```
.code https://example.com/callback?code=abc123xyz
```

> If you're using an older version of nowFy, please update to v1.0.2 or later to use the full URL method.

## 7. Check if Everything Works

Run the following command to verify your setup:

```
.check
```

---

## 8. Show What You’re Listening To

Use this command anytime to display your currently playing track:

```
.now
```
