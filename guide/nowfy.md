## 3. Set Credentials in the Plugin

In your chat with the plugin, send:

```
.setid YOUR_CLIENT_ID
```
Then:

```
.setsecret YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET
```

---

## 4. Generate Your Login Link

Now that your credentials are set, run:

```
.update
```

This will generate a personalized link using your Client ID.

---

## 5. Authorize the App

- Open the link generated by `.update`
- Log in to your Spotify account
- Click **"Agree"** to authorize the app

✅ Done authorizing?

➡️ Return to the chat and **open the same link again**.  
This time, it will redirect you to a URL like:

![nowFy](https://github.com/soumaki/nowFy/blob/main/img/App.png)

```
https://example.com/callback?code=YOUR_CODE_HERE
```

Copy the value that comes **after `code=`** in the URL.

---

## 6. Submit the Code

Paste the code into the plugin using:

```
.code YOUR_CODE_HERE
```
