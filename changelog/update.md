# Whatâ€™s New in nowFy?

CONTROLS  
With the latest nowFy update, you can now control your music without ever leaving ExteraGram.  
You can:  
- Pause or resume the current track  
- Skip to the next track  
- Go back to the previous track  

Just use these simple commands:  
â€¢ `.p` â€” Play or Pause  
â€¢ `.n` â€” Next Track  
â€¢ `.b` â€” Previous Track  

Additionally, some commands now trigger **notifications (bulletins)** to keep you informed seamlessly.

# SEARCH  
This is where it gets exciting!  
You can now search for tracks or albums directly from any chat, with results limited to 5 items to keep things clean.  
Hereâ€™s how it works:

Use `.s` to search. For example:  
```
.s out of time, the weeknd
```
(or just the song name)

Youâ€™ll get a list of the top 5 Spotify results. Then simply select which one to play using:  
```
.play 1
```

Want to search for albums instead? Use:  
```
.s .album Dawn FM
```
And again, to play the album:  
```
.play 1
```

**Bonus:** You can optionally choose whether to display the currently playing track info in chat when you select a song or album.

## NOTE
If you're unable to skip, go back, or control playback, it's very likely that you're using a Free Spotify account. Spotify imposes strict limitations on non-Premium users, and unfortunately, there's nothing we can do to bypass those restrictions.
Premium users have full access to all playback features.

## UNDER THE HOOD  
- Code has been polished for better performance and stability  
- Improved translations  
- The changelog is now built into the plugin: no more external links or pages  
- Probably added more things we forgot ðŸ˜…  

Expect more features and updates soon!  
**Fun fact:** This plugin started with one goal â€” just to show the current Spotify track with a beautiful design... and look at it now.
